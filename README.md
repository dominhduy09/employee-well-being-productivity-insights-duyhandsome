Employee Well-Being & Productivity Insights is a Tableau Next dashboard that integrates HR and Salesforce data to track absenteeism, satisfaction, productivity, and turnover. It highlights burnout risks and sends proactive Slack alerts so HR can take action before issues escalate.

We used Tableau Next, Salesforce Data Cloud, and Slack integration. With more time, we’d add predictive modeling to forecast turnover, integrate additional HR platforms (like Workday), and incorporate sentiment analysis from employee surveys for deeper insights.


## Inspiration
- Employee well-being is directly tied to organizational success, yet HR teams often struggle to identify burnout, absenteeism, and productivity risks early enough. We wanted to create a solution that turns HR data into actionable insights so companies can support their people before problems escalate.


## What it does
Our Tableau Next dashboard integrates HR and Salesforce data to:
- Monitor satisfaction, absenteeism, and productivity trends by department.
- Identify burnout risks through combined health and performance signals.
- Track turnover rates and highlight at-risk teams.
- Send proactive Slack alerts when teams cross risk thresholds, enabling managers to act quickly.

## How we built it
- Designed a structured dataset simulating employee health and productivity trends.
- Loaded data into Tableau Next and created calculated metrics for absenteeism, productivity, and turnover.
- Built interactive dashboards: KPIs, trend lines, absenteeism heatmaps, and turnover charts.
- Integrated Slack alerts for real-time risk notifications using Salesforce connectors.

## Challenges we ran into
- Balancing multiple metrics (satisfaction, absenteeism, productivity, turnover) without overwhelming the dashboard.
- Designing thresholds for meaningful Slack alerts that avoid false positives.
- Data modeling — ensuring employee-level data could be aggregated into department-level insights.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Built a clean, efficient, and actionable Tableau Next dashboard in limited time.
- Created a workflow where HR can identify risks and receive real-time alerts.
- Showcased how analytics can improve not just revenue, but employee well-being and retention.

## What we learned
- How to leverage Tableau Next on the Salesforce platform for workforce analytics.
- The power of integrating analytics with collaboration tools like Slack for faster action.
- The importance of balancing data visualization simplicity with depth of insights.

## What's next for Employee Well-Being & Productivity Insights - duyhandsome
- Incorporating predictive modeling to forecast burnout and turnover before they happen.
- Expanding integration with HR platforms (Workday, SAP SuccessFactors) for real-world deployments.
- Adding anonymized employee sentiment analysis from surveys or Slack messages.
- Deploying dashboards across organizations to promote healthier, more productive workplaces.
